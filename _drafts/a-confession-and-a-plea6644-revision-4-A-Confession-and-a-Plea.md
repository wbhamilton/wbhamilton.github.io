I have a confession to make. It&#8217;s not easy for me to say this, but the truth needs to come out. And while I wish there were alternatives, this is just the way things are, and I need to embrace it.

I wear women&#8217;s socks.

I don&#8217;t like that I wear women&#8217;s socks. The men&#8217;s sock industry has forced my hand in this. I would love to wear men&#8217;s socks. I am a man after all. But it just doesn&#8217;t work. You see, I have small(ish) feet. Depending on the shoe I&#8217;m between a size 7 and a size 8. Fashionable socks don&#8217;t exist in my size. I&#8217;ve looked. Everywhere. And I refuse to pay $35 for a pair of socks&#8230;so don&#8217;t send my any of those links.

The ONE SIZE FITS ALL label is a lie. If it were true I&#8217;d happily walk into the GAP and buy my socks from them. But I&#8217;ve tried that as well. Call me crazy, but I just don&#8217;t like the look where the heal of the sock is half way up my calf. The ONE SIZE FITS ALL mantra works for those men with a size 10-12&#8230;not for us MEN in the more petite range. Instead, I walk into the GAP and sheepishly make my way to the women&#8217;s socks. They actually have a nice array of choices. And they fit. Sure, I sometimes have to deal with a slight ruffle at the the top of my socks, but no one sees that. I hope.

I&#8217;ve also just recently been informed, by my wife, that Target has a nice choice of women&#8217;s socks. Over the weekend I picked up five pairs for $15. No shame in that. The next time you see me ask me to lift up my trousers&#8230;I&#8217;ll gladly show you my girls socks. Or I&#8217;ll run crying to the bathroom&#8230;I haven&#8217;t decided yet.

And to the men&#8217;s sock makers of the world â€” STOP IT! Give us small footed men socks that fit. Make them for us. We&#8217;ll buy them. I promise. Just stop trying to sell us the lie that one size fits all. You&#8217;re bruising our ego. And that&#8217;s good for no man&#8230;regardless of how big his feet are.
