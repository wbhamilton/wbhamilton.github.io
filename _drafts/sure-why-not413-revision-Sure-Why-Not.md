Three months, four posts, and now a re-design&#8230;sure, why not. I had great hopes for this site. I dreamt of it being a holding place for all things &#8220;me&#8221;. The dream is still there, but the thing about dreams&#8230;if you don&#8217;t get off your bum and do something with them they&#8217;ll just remain dreams. And so, I find myself busy with life, not giving to this site what I intended to give.

Then, after looking at it for a couple of months I decided I didn&#8217;t like the way it looked. So I set off on a search for a new look. I finally settled on the nice [Bloggingstream](http://www.woothemes.com/2009/04/bloggingstream/) theme by [Woothemes](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=389&i=b5). I&#8217;m not finished tweaking things. I still need to clean up the type and make sure some links are working properly. But for the most part things are as they should be.

So why should you care&#8230;because I&#8217;m ready to make the dream a reality. I&#8217;m ready to give to the site what I initially set out to give. If you&#8217;re still interested in following along and joining in then I welcome you.

And by the way, just because I&#8217;ve not been active here doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve not been active at all. Sometimes it&#8217;s just easier to post to [Tumblr](http://wbhamilton.tumblr.com/), and of course [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wbhamilton).
