I recently purchased a [Flip Mino HD](http://www.theflip.com/products_flip_mino.shtml#scene=sceneMain). Overall I&#8217;ve been really impressed with the camera. It&#8217;s dead simple to use, small enough to fit in your pocket, and provides very good picture quality. The one downside would be image stabilization. Because of the small size and light weight of the camera it can be difficult to keep still while recording. And forget about walking while shooting and getting a still picture. Another small gripe is that the FlipShare software, while allowing simple uploading to YouTube, it doesn&#8217;t allow for the uploading of HD video.

Here&#8217;s a short clip (50 seconds) of the view from the back of our house.
