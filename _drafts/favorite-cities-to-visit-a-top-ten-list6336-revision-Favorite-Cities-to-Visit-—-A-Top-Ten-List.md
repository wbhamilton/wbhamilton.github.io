My friend Jason Dietz, over at [NonModern](http://www.nonmodernblog.com/ "NonModern"), recently [posted](http://d.pr/KFl1) a list of his top ten cities to visit. I loved the list. Jason is much more traveled than I am, I&#8217;ve only been to two of his top ten cities, but I thought I would &#8220;comment&#8221; on his post by posting my own list of the top ten cities I&#8217;ve visited. Like Jason, I won&#8217;t include any city that I live, currently or previously. Unlike Jason though, I don&#8217;t stop at the &#8220;city&#8221; designation, and will include a couple of &#8220;metropolis'&#8221; — I couldn&#8217;t resist.
