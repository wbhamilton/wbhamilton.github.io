Three weeks ago I started a self-imposed photography project called Project 50. Project 50&#8217;s are fairly popular on Flickr, and where I first heard about them. Project 50 is simple, in theory at least – you take 50 photos over 50 straight days with a 50mm prime lens. I became really interested in doing a Project 50 after seeing this [one](http://d.pr/WWE7). However, while Rick&#8217;s is fairly consistent throughout, with a cinematic type theme, I wanted to do one that wasn&#8217;t quite as specialized or focused. I&#8217;m still trying to uncover what type of photography I&#8217;m best at because I&#8217;m interested in several different genres (urban landscapes, still, portraits). I thought a Project 50 would be a beneficial way of finding out what type of photograph I&#8217;m drawn to most often. And after hearing a talk given by [David Hurn](http://d.pr/rqb6) I was reminded that you only get better as a photographer by shooting copious amounts of photos. To get these first 21 photographs I&#8217;ve shot well over 500 pictures.

I&#8217;m learning that inspiration doesn&#8217;t come when you want it to, and will most likely come when you least expect it. I&#8217;m learning to take my camera with me at all times. I&#8217;m learning that as good as a picture may be it&#8217;s always an advantage to know how to edit in the darkroom&#8230;and by darkroom I mean [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/). I&#8217;m learning that when you&#8217;re shooting more than just the general snapshot, time and focus must be given to insure a better than average photograph. I&#8217;m learning that not everyone will like or appreciate what you&#8217;ve shot – and I&#8217;m generally okay with that. And I&#8217;m learning that I love to take photographs. While the task is daunting, I&#8217;m looking forward to reaching the halfway point in a couple days and then completing the project on March 6th.

The two photographs below are: 1 – the most viewed photograph so far. And 2 – my favorite so far.
