In an op-ed for the NY Times, [Warren Buffett proposes a minimum tax on high incomes](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/opinion/buffett-a-minimum-tax-for-the-wealthy.html), specifically &#8220;30 percent of taxable income between $1 million and $10 million, and 35 percent on amounts above that&#8221;. He argues that higher tax rates will not curtail investment activity.

> Between 1951 and 1954, when the capital gains rate was 25 percent and marginal rates on dividends reached 91 percent in extreme cases, I sold securities and did pretty well. In the years from 1956 to 1969, the top marginal rate fell modestly, but was still a lofty 70 percent &#8211; and the tax rate on capital gains inched up to 27.5 percent. I was managing funds for investors then. Never did anyone mention taxes as a reason to forgo an investment opportunity that I offered.
> 
> Under those burdensome rates, moreover, both employment and the gross domestic product (a measure of the nation&#8217;s economic output) increased at a rapid clip. The middle class and the rich alike gained ground.
