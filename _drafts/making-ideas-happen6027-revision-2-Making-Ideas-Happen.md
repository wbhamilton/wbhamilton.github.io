I was cleaning out an old notebook and came across a few notes I jotted down at a conference a couple of years ago where [Scott Belsky](http://twitter.com/#!/ScottBelsky) from [Behance](http://www.behance.net/) was talking about [Making Ideas Happen](http://the99percent.com/book). I only caught the last half of his talk, but I thought the notes were worth passing along.

# MAKING IDEAS HAPPEN {COMMUNALLY}

  * Share Ideas Liberally
  * Share Ownership of Ideas
  * Seek Competition
  * Fight Your Way to Breakthrough
  * Don’t become burdened by consensus // find sacred extremes &#8211; compromise on rest
  * Overcome the Stigma of Self Marketing. Make sure others know what you’re good at.

# MAKING IDEAS HAPPEN {LEADERSHIP}

  * Leaders talk last (silence the visionary)
  * Develop Others through appreciation
  * Reduce your amount of ‘Insecurity Work’
  * Seek Restraint
  * Judge based on Initiative (Not experience)
  * Value Chemistry Over People
  * Unique is Opportune. Defy the status-quo. Shunned before celebrated.</ul>
