Hi. My name is Brad Hamilton, and you&#8217;ve found my site&#8230;1twentyeight.com. I currently live in the UK where I am the director of a charity called [CommunityOne](http://www.communityone.org.uk). I was born and raised in the great state of Texas. I&#8217;m married and have two brilliant children. You can follow our family at [thelifeandtimesof.com](http://www.thelifeandtimesof.com).

I plan to use 1twentyeight as a place to write about things that I&#8217;m passionate about: the missional life, theology, technology, design, photography, and Mac&#8217;s.

You can follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/wbhamilton), see some of my photos on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehuddle/), or subscribe to the feed here at [1twentyeight](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/1twentyeight).
