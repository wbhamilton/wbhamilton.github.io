It&#8217;s time again for my top five albums of the year. As I was preparing for this post, and I&#8217;ve probably always known this, I realized that while I love music, I&#8217;m not going to spend time searching for the unheard-of bands, or the albums that no one knows of. I&#8217;m not a true audiophile in that sense. But I do love good music. I could never compile a [list](http://www.stevekmccoy.com/reformissionary/2012/12/best-albums-of-2012.html) like Steve McCoy&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t have the time or the budget. And to be fair, I&#8217;m certain that there are several albums on Steve&#8217;s list that would be included in mine. No, my tastes are slightly more mainstream. And while you&#8217;ll never see the likes of today&#8217;s Pop Stars on this list you will most likely know the bands that are mentioned here.

Just like last year, I thought I would mention several albums that were good, but didn&#8217;t make the list [<sup>1</sup>](#note-6606-1 "All links are Amazon Affiliate links"){#return-note-6606-1.simple-footnote}.

This year&#8217;s most disappointing album was [Battle Born](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00973DDN2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00973DDN2) by The Killers. I was really looking forward to it, but goodness, what a mess. They seem miles away from the band that gave us [Hot Fuss](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1586S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000W1586S) & [Sam&#8217;s Town](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZYXPC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VZYXPC).

Sigur Ros** — [Valtari](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084P9202/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0084P9202)

This band is Icelandic. I have no idea what they&#8217;re singing, which is okay because some of their songs use a non-literal language&#8230;basically made up sounds. It&#8217;s called Vonlenska. Wikipedia calls them an ambient/post-rock band. It doesn&#8217;t matter their language, or what Wikipedia calls them&#8230;they&#8217;re good. The music is ethereal and mesmerizing.

Best song: Fjögur píanó

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6592" alt="grizzlybear" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/grizzlybear.jpeg" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/grizzlybear.jpeg 280w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/grizzlybear-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /> **4. Grizzly Bear** — [Shields](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098WWEH8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0098WWEH8)

I didn&#8217;t pick this album up until really late in the year&#8230;but I can&#8217;t stop listening to it. Initially it reminded me of My Morning Jacket. But Grizzly Bear is better, both musically and lyrically. This album features great harmonies between Edward Droste & Daniel Rossen.[

Best Song: Sun In Your Eyes

> Fallen once, you&#8217;ll fall again  
> And lean on  
> Your tired hands, the crawling grass  
> The soft ground

**<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6597" alt="lumineers" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lumineers.jpeg" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lumineers.jpeg 280w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lumineers-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" />3. The Lumineers** — [The Lumineers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007M45PMU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007M45PMU)

You know the Lumineers because you&#8217;ve likely heard _Ho Hey_ about a thousand times on the radio. Fortunately the album is more than that one song. And fortunately, most of the other songs are better than _Ho Hey_. Lyrically easy on the ears&#8230;and you can sing along with all the songs.

Best Song: Stubborn Love

> It&#8217;s better to feel pain, than nothing at all  
> The opposite of love&#8217;s indifference  
> Pay attention now, I&#8217;m standing on your porch screaming out  
> And I wont leave until you come downstairs

**<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6600" alt="monsters" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/monsters.jpeg" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/monsters.jpeg 280w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/monsters-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" />2. Of Monsters and Men** — [My Head Is An Animal](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007MU85D0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007MU85D0)

The guitar intro on the first song, _Dirty Paws_, instantly hooked me&#8230;and I didn&#8217;t stop listening. This is an  album that takes the listener from a story about bees, birds, and creatures with _Dirty Paws_ to a romantic discourse between lovers in _Little Talks_. Incidentally, this band is also from Iceland. What is it about good music coming from Iceland? I thought Björk was that country&#8217;s only export. The music is whimsical, wispy, a little folksy. And good.

Best Song: Little Talks

> You&#8217;re gone, gone, gone away  
> I watched you disappear  
> All that&#8217;s left is a ghost of you  
> Now we&#8217;re torn, torn, torn apart  
> There&#8217;s nothing we can do  
> Just let me go, we&#8217;ll meet again soon

Mumford & Sons** — [Babel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009A3NGF4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009A3NGF4)
