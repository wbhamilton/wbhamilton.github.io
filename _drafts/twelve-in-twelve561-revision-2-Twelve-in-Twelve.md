Yesterday I took part in my first [Photomarathon](http://www.photomarathon.co.uk). The concept is quite simple really. I had 12 hours to take 12 photos based on 12 topics. At the end of the day I had to turn in my 12 photos, in order from 1 to 12. At 10AM some 400 participants received the first four topics. We returned to the Wales Millennium Centre at 2PM to receive the next four, and then at 6PM we returned for our final four topics. All 12 were due by 10PM. The photos could not be edited, they could not be out of order, and there could only be one photo for each topic.

Overall I had a good time. Next year I&#8217;d like to get the family involved in the whole day. My wife is far more creative than I, and I know the kids would have a good time with it. It was a long, tiring day, but worth the effort. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing everyone&#8217;s photos and the winners on July 23.

Here are the topics, followed by a link to my set in Flickr.

Topics 1-4:

  1. My Entry Number + Giant
  2. Aroma
  3. On a shoe string
  4. Inspiration

  1. Up in the air
  2. Arc
  3. Seven
  4. Fail
