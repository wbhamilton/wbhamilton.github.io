Today on my Twitter stream I&#8217;ve been posting my all time top 5 songs from U2. I&#8217;m headed to the concert in Dallas today and am a little pumped about it. I&#8217;ve seen U2 4 times dating back to their 1997 Pop Mart tour. That show was held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. The next 3 shows went indoors&#8230;once in Reunion Arena, once in the new American Airlines arena, and once in some arena in Kansas City.
