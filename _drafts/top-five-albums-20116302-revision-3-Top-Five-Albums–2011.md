Despite what a friend said [last year](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums—2010/) about 2010 being a bad year for music, I thought it was a good year. Maybe that&#8217;s because Mumford&#8217;s _Sigh No More_ and Arcade Fire&#8217;s _Suburbs_ are 2 of my favorite albums. In fact, I would argue that 2011 was no better than 2010, and in some respects, a little worse. While my #1 album is good, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s nearly as good as _Sigh No More_. Last year there was a distinct #2 for me, while this year my #2 through #4 could all be moved around. They&#8217;re all good, but one didn&#8217;t necessarily stand out over the others. And like last year, I&#8217;m including an album that might incite a little ridicule by my friends. Oh well, I liked it.

#5 Adelle &#8211; [21](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4S4NM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004P4S4NM)  
Like Brandon Flowers last year, this choice might catch a little ridicule. But let&#8217;s be honest, Adelle&#8217;s voice is second to none. The vocals on this album are simply amazing. I thought I would tire of this album after a few listens, but I keep coming back to it. Sad at times, empowering at others, well rounded, solid. Best song –

#4 Death Cab for Cutie &#8211; [Codes and Keys](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052YOXN4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0052YOXN4)  
Probably the most upbeat of my five albums (_Stay Young, Go Dancing_), and Death Cab for Cutie&#8217;s best album to date. Driving bass, a saloon piano, and maybe a little bit too much hi-hat. But you&#8217;ll be tapping your foot, and singing along. Best Song – _Portable Television_

#3 Fleet Foxes &#8211; [Helplessness Blues](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X0XA82/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004X0XA82)  
Wispy, airy, singing out in a wheat field kind of sound, but with amplification. The first three songs warm you up, almost like inside pitches in baseball, they get you ready – then Battery Kinzie is like a fastball right over the middle of the plate&#8230;a strong, sit up straight kind of song. Crisp guitars, tight vocals, a really nice album. Best song – _Helplessness Blues_

#2 Bon Iver &#8211; [Bon Iver](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054JURZA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0054JURZA)  
Listen to the first song, _Perth_, and wait for the swell at the 2:35 mark – you&#8217;ll be hooked. The lead singer, Justin Vernon, sings a lot in falsetto and it works. The song titles are mainly geographical (Perth, Minnesota, Hinnom, Calgary, Lisbon), and the lyrics may not make the most sense. But the album works, and you&#8217;ll want to continue to listen. Best Song – _Michicant_

#1 Elbow &#8211; [Build A Rocket Boys!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PVF95Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004PVF95Q)  
I&#8217;m simply amazed at how this album has been left off list after list for top album of the year. Maybe it&#8217;s because Elbow doesn&#8217;t get much play here in the States. I found Elbow, or maybe they found me, while living in the UK. Their previous album, _The Seldom Seen Kid_, was really good and met with critical acclaim  – in the UK at least, but _Build A Rocket Boys!_ is exponentially better (in my opinion).
