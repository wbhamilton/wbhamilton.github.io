Imagine doing your grocery shopping with a device that allows you to see if the toilet paper you&#8217;re about to purchase was manufactured in an environmentally friendly way. Or imagine walking up to someone on the street and within seconds of meeting the person you know his background, where he works, where he lives, what groups he belongs to. Pattie Maes from MIT thinks it&#8217;s possible. She demoed such a device at TED. Enjoy.
