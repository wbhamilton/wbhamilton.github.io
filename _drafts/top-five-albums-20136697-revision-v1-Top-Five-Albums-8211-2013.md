Two things changed the way I listened to music in 2013. Spotify & Vinyl. Almost every album that I listened to this year was through Spotify first. I did not make a single purchase without first _testing_ the album out for free. I love Spotify. This year also ushered in the return of the turntable into the Hamilton house. It’s been over two decades since I last had a record player. But the boy came home from school one day wanting to get into vinyl (he’s a third grader). So we did. I love that it’s turned music back into a physical experience for me. From the crackles and pops to having to _turn_ the album over, it’s made music fun.

## The Top Five

I&#8217;ve put these five albums in a Spotify playlist for your listening pleasure: [Listen](http://d.pr/bcFl)

### 5. The Head and the Heart &ndash; Let’s Be Still

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/1twentyeight/uploads/five.jpg" alt="5" class="alignleft" /> 

This sophomore album is really good. Looking back, their first album (self-titled) should have been included in my Honorable Mentions for 2011. This album is more grown-up, more emotional, and the harmonies are even better than they were in their first album.

Best Song: _Gone_

### 4. The National &ndash; Trouble Will Find Me

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/1twentyeight/uploads/four.jpg" alt="4" class="alignleft" /> 

The National never seem to disappoint. While this album is not as good as their _High Violet_ album from 2010, it still delivers. You’ll notice two things on this album: Matt Berninger’s vocals & Bryan Devendorf’s drums. This album is just as melancholy as previous albums, maybe even more so. But it will hook you.

Best Song: _Hard to Find_. _Demons_ is a close second.

### 3. Arcade Fire &ndash; Reflektor

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/1twentyeight/uploads/three.jpg" alt="3" class="alignleft" /> 

Reflektor is a very good album, but not the best the band has ever produced. It will be hard for Arcade Fire to top _Suburbs_ from 2010. This album is a different sound for Arcade Fire. It reminds me a little of when U2 changed things up with _Pop_. You know it’s them, but it doesn’t exactly _sound_ like them. Still, it’s a very enjoyable album.

Best Song: _Here Comes the Night Time_

### 2. Cold War Kids &ndash; Dear Miss Lonelyhearts

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/1twentyeight/uploads/two.jpg" alt="2" class="alignleft" /> 

In 2011 my number one album for the year was Elbow’s _Build a Rocket Boys!_. I remarked then that I was shocked that it wasn’t included on any official top album lists for that year. This year I have the same shock that _Dear Miss Lonelyhearts_ is no where to be found. It didn’t even make Rolling Stone’s Top 50 for the year. Utterly confusing. The first song, _Miracle Mile_, hooks you and it doesn’t let go. This is foot-tapping, dancing in the living room good.

Best Song: _Tuxedos_

### 1. Vampire Weekend &ndash; Modern Vampires of the City

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/1twentyeight/uploads/one.jpg" alt="1" class="alignleft" /> 

I really don’t now how to start other than saying…this album is amazing. It’s dark, deep, and spiritual. I have a tendency to be drawn to the spiritual implications in lyrics and this album is rich with them. I won’t bore you with listing them out, or try to interpret them. This album covers youth, wisdom that comes with age, fear of getting older, and questioning God, but I never felt preached at. I ended up singing along, nodding in agreement. Every song is excellent. In fact, it’s extremely difficult to pick my favorite…but if I were forced I’d have to go with _Unvbelievers_, the second song on the album. Here are the lyrics:

> Got a little soul  
> The world is a cold, cold place to be  
> Want a little warmth  
> But who’s gonna save a little warmth for me?
> 
> We know the fire awaits unbelievers  
> All of the sinners the same  
> Girl, you and I will die unbelievers  
> Bound to the tracks of the train
> 
> If I’m born again I know that the world will disagree  
> Want a little grace but who’s gonna say a little grace for me?
> 
> We know the fire awaits unbelievers  
> All of the sinners the same  
> Girl, you and I will die unbelievers  
> Bound to the tracks of the train
> 
> I’m not excited, but should I be?  
> Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
> 
> I know I love you  
> And you love the sea  
> But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?
> 
> See the sun go down  
> It’s going on down, and the night is deep  
> Want a little light  
> But who’s gonna save a little light for me?
> 
> We know the fire awaits unbelievers  
> All of the sinners the same  
> Girl, you and I will die unbelievers  
> Bound to the tracks of the train
> 
> I’m not excited, but should I be?  
> Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
> 
> I know I love you  
> And you love the sea  
> But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?
> 
> I’m not excited, but should I be?  
> Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
> 
> I know I love you  
> And you love the sea  
> But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?
