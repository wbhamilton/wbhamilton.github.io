Hey Twitter, you don&#8217;t build a platform/service that&#8217;s free and open, build up a ridiculous user base, then [change](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api) the rules on how the game is played. It&#8217;s douchey. It comes across like the kid at the playground who didn&#8217;t get his way, called a timeout, grabbed his ball, walked home and left all the other kids thinking &#8220;what the hell just happened&#8221;.

It&#8217;s not our fault you didn&#8217;t have a solid business model when you started. Or, if you did and this was it&#8230;that&#8217;s double douchey.

Twitter is the new Happy Days. The 5th season premiere included the now infamous scene where Fonzie [jumped over a shark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark) while water-skiing. Before this episode&#8230;great show. After this episode&#8230;the decline of a great show. With the new API Twitter just gave us their 5th season premiere.
