Yesterday I took part in my second [Photomarathon](http://www.photomarathon.co.uk/). I naively thought that [last years effort](http://1twentyeight.com/2010/06/13/twelve-in-twelve/) would provide invaluable experience for this year. But nothing can prepare you for the exhaustion that comes with trying to take 12 photographs over 12 hours on 12 different topics. And while I felt better prepared in terms of taking pictures that the judges would appreciate, and interpreting the topics in a _different_ way, I was still thrilled when the day was over and I could turn off my brain.

This year Julie and the kids played a big part in helping me. We had a great time as a family thinking through the shots and then executing them.

I also wanted to say that the team behind Photomarathon, Betina Skovbro, Mathew Talfan & the rest, did an absolutely fabulous job. To coordinate a one day event with over 400 participants in no small task. This year, and last, went as smoothly as possible â€” from a participants perspective.

This years topics were:
