Everyone has their lists this time of year, from top grossing movies to the top searches on Google. It only makes sense that I add my own list for 2010&#8230;albeit a short one. My top five albums for 2010 are not based on anything other than what I liked the most. Of course, I listened, and purchased more than five albums this year, but these are my favourite. Enjoy.

1. Mumford & Sons &#8211; [Sigh No More](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038BBA4I?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0038BBA4I").[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5983" title="Mumford" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mumford.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" />](http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mumford.jpg)  
Truly incredible album. Folk, Country, and Rock all wrapped up into a unique sound. Driving, beating anthems, and moody, passionate real life lyrics. I&#8217;ve yet to tire listening to this album.

In these body&#8217;s we will live, in these body&#8217;s we will die. Where you invest your love, you invest your life.
