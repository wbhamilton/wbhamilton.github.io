I seriously can&#8217;t stop eating [these](http://cl.ly/BNBo "Juanitas Tortilla Chips"). I have a small obsession with tortilla chips. I have forever been on the hunt for the perfect tortilla chip and I have found it. Meet [Juanitas](http://cl.ly/BMWq "Juanitas"). One would think that these chips are made in the heart of Texas, or even better, Mexico. But no, these delectable bits of fried tortilla are made in&#8230;wait for it&#8230;Bend, Oregon. Seriously.

Do yourself a favor, find your nearest retailer and run to the store and buy a bag, or two or three.
