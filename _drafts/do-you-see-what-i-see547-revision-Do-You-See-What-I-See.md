One week from tomorrow my family and I will board a plane and head back to Cardiff, Wales (UK) after spending the last six months here in the US. Most of our time was spent in Texas, both in San Antonio and Ft. Worth (Granbury actually). We&#8217;ve had a really enjoyable time, but I think I&#8217;m ready to head back. After 31 years in the US, then 3 1/2 years in the UK, and now six months back in the US I&#8217;ve been able to see things from a slightly different perspective and I thought I would share some of my thoughts. My perspective is not right, nor wrong, just mine.

  * America is easy. Now don&#8217;t misunderstand me. We all have our issues. Some of us are facing aging grandparents, and losing children, and losing jobs, and you name it. But that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about. I&#8217;m talking about the relative ease with which we live as Americans. We can walk into Target, Walmart, any grocery store really, and live forever. Honestly, we can not live in this country and complain for lack of want.
  * America is rich. If you, or someone you know, earn $45,000 a year then you, or someone you know, is part of the richest 1% of the world. We seriously need to stop living above our means and give more, then save more.
  * Church is still a big deal&#8230;well, in the South it is. Honestly, how many more multi-thousand seat churches do we need in a given city? And here&#8217;s the reason I ask&#8230;if true transformation is taking place at these huge churches then why are cities not changing? Maybe I&#8217;m an idealist, but I would love to see whole cities transformed by these churches that obviously have the resources, and I&#8217;m not just talking about money.
  * Politics are an idol for far too many followers of Jesus.
  * Football might be a close second.
  * I honestly feel that there is a small yet growing movement within the evangelical world that could really shape things in America. It&#8217;s happening in a very viral way, by guys many of us have not heard of. But it is gospel-centered and could be something to watch.
  * SUV&#8217;s have exponentially increased in individual size and overall frequency. Don&#8217;t quite get it.
  * Friends are awesome.
