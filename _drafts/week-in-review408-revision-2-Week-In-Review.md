Here are some things that caught my attention this week:

  * [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/) for Mac comes out on Monday, April 20th. I&#8217;m pretty excited about this one. After trying Tweetdeck, Eventbox, and Nambu, I&#8217;m hoping Tweetie succeeds where the others have failed.
  * [London Street Fashion](http://ftp2.dns-systems.net/~sams/LSF/new_map.html) is a pretty cool site that shows fashion photos from different parts of London.
  * [Oprah](http://twitter.com/oprah) is on Twitter. It&#8217;s suddenly less attractive to me now.
  * I&#8217;m really digging the look of Tim Van Damme&#8217;s personal site &#8211; [maxvoltar.com](http://maxvoltar.com/). Very clean look, nice use of the grid.
  * Church in Britain is in a sad state of affairs. [NPR Article](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102922503&ft=1&f=100).

Have a great Sunday. See you next week.
