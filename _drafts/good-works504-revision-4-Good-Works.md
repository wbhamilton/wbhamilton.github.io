One of the things I&#8217;m passionate about is what I would call a Good Works Initiative. Simply, it&#8217;s about doing good works for others. Giving back. Assisting. Offering help. Creating something for the betterment of a person, group, or community. Some, like me, are motivated to do good works because of my faith. Not in some under-handed scheme to get the recipient to convert, but because I believe my faith requires nothing less than doing good for others. Others may not be motivated to do good works because of faith in a higher being, but it does not diminish their ability to have an impact on another&#8217;s life.

I&#8217;m seeing a lot of this good works initiative as I meet and talk with others and as I crawl the interwebs. Here are a few places I see the good works initiative being lived out: (disclaimer: some will be faith based while others will not)
