It&#8217;s time again for my top five albums of the year. As I was preparing for this post, and I&#8217;ve probably always known this, I realized that I&#8217;m while I love music, I&#8217;m not going to spend time searching for the unheard-of bands, or the albums that no one knows of. I&#8217;m not a true audiophile in that sense. But I do love good music. I could never compile a [list](http://www.stevekmccoy.com/reformissionary/2012/12/best-albums-of-2012.html) like Steve McCoy&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t have the time or the budget. And to be fair, I&#8217;m certain that there are several albums on Steve&#8217;s list that would be included in mine. No, my tastes are slightly more mainstream. And while you&#8217;ll never see the likes of today&#8217;s Pop Stars on this list you will most likely know the bands that are mentioned here.

[Top Five — 2011](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums-2011/)

Just like last year, I thought I would mention several albums that were good, but didn&#8217;t make the list.
