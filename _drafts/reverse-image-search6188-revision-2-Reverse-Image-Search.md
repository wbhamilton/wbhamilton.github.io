I may be late to the party on this, but I had no idea one could perform a reverse image search on Google. What&#8217;s a reverse image search? It&#8217;s where you have an image but would like to know where it came from&#8230;it&#8217;s source, creator, etc.

Here&#8217;s how:  
&#8211; Navigate to the Image search on Google — [http://images.google.com](http://images.google.com/ "Google Images")  
&#8211; Drag an image from your desktop to the search field. I used [this one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/48889052497@N01/5942574303):  
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6189" title="5942574303_095319fa4e_b" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5942574303_095319fa4e_b-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5942574303_095319fa4e_b-300x168.jpg 300w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5942574303_095319fa4e_b.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> 

&#8211; As you drag the image into the search bar it changes to indicate that you can drop the image into the search bar.  
[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6190" title="Google Chrome" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Google-Chrome-300x184.png" alt="" width="300" height="184" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Google-Chrome-300x184.png 300w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Google-Chrome.png 929w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Google-Chrome.png)

&#8211; Google uploads the image to the search engine and gives you it&#8217;s best guess as the search result.

Very cool.
