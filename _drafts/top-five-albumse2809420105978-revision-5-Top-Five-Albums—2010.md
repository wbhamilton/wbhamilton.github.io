Everyone has their lists this time of year, from top grossing movies to the top searches on Google. It only makes sense that I add my own list for 2010&#8230;albeit a short one. My top five albums for 2010 are not based on anything other than what I liked the most. Of course, I listened, and purchased more than five albums this year, but these are my favourite. Enjoy.

1. Mumford & Sons &#8211; [Sigh No More](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038BBA4I?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0038BBA4I").[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5983" title="Mumford" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mumford.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" />](http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mumford.jpg)  
A truly incredible album. Folk, Country, and Rock all wrapped up into one unique sound. Driving, beating anthems, and moody, passionate real life lyrics. With spiritual undertones and love lost, it could be anyone&#8217;s story. I&#8217;ve yet to tire listening to this album. For those in the UK, yes this was released toward the end of 2009. But in the US it wasn&#8217;t released until February, 2010. So I&#8217;m cheating a little&#8230;playing to both audiences. If there&#8217;s a way for me to sneak it into my top five for 2011 I might do it.

Best Lyric: In these body&#8217;s we will live, in these body&#8217;s we will die. Where you invest your love, you invest your life. _Awake My Soul_.

2. Arcade Fire &#8211; [The Suburbs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X73QA8?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003X73QA8).[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5980" title="ArcadeFire" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ArcadeFire.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" />](http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ArcadeFire.jpg)  
While Sigh No More could be anyone&#8217;s album, The Suburbs was my album. I immediately connected with this album about the result of suburban sprawl, the new culture it creates, and the culture that is left to die downtown. This is clearly an &#8220;American&#8221; album (even though the band is from Montreal). I&#8217;ve wondered how British listeners would relate to songs about the suburbs when the cities here in the UK are very different from the US. When I hear these songs I immediately think of Dallas and Houston and wonder what cities the British listener thinks of.

Best Lyric: You never <a href="http://lyrics.wikia.com/Arcade_Fire:City_With_No_Children#" target="_blank">trust</a> a millionaire quoting the sermon on the mount;  
I used to think I was not like them but I&#8217;m beginning to have my doubts, my doubts about it. _City With No Children_.
