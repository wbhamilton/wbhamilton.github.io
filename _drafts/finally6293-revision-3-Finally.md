The search is over. The waiting has ended. And the celebration has begun.

Julie and I knew back in February of this year that our time in Cardiff, Wales was coming to an end and that we needed to move back to the US. In March of this year I came to Portland to decide if this was the city for us. It was, and we started planning towards the big move. I started searching for a job in earnest in May â€” and it has finally culminated in a new job as an Education Consultant with [Ochin](http://www.ochin.org).

I start my new career on Monday, December 5th, and I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about it.
