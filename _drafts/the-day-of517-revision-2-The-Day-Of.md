Today on my Twitter [stream](http://twitter.com/wbhamilton) I&#8217;ve been posting my all time top 5 songs from U2. I&#8217;m headed to the concert in Dallas today and am a little pumped about it. I&#8217;ve seen U2 4 times dating back to their 1997 Pop Mart tour. That show was held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. The next 3 shows went indoors&#8230;once in Reunion Arena, once in the new(er) American Airlines Center, and once in some arena in Kansas City. Tonight&#8217;s is back to the outdoors (kind of) in the new Cowboys Stadium. I&#8217;ve read good reviews of the opening band, Muse, and am excited to hear them live for the first time.

Here&#8217;s my top 5 (and a couple of honorable mentions):

  1. I Still Haven&#8217;t Found What I&#8217;m Looking For
  2. One
  3. Who&#8217;s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses
  4. Walk On
  5. Yahweh

Honorable Mentions:

  1. 40
  2. Sometimes You Can&#8217;t Make I
