It&#8217;s time again for my top five albums of the year. As I was preparing for this post, and I&#8217;ve probably always known this, I realized that while I love music, I&#8217;m not going to spend time searching for the unheard-of bands, or the albums that no one knows of. I&#8217;m not a true audiophile in that sense. But I do love good music. I could never compile a [list](http://www.stevekmccoy.com/reformissionary/2012/12/best-albums-of-2012.html) like Steve McCoy&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t have the time or the budget. And to be fair, I&#8217;m certain that there are several albums on Steve&#8217;s list that would be included in mine. No, my tastes are slightly more mainstream. And while you&#8217;ll never see the likes of today&#8217;s Pop Stars on this list you will most likely know the bands that are mentioned here.

Just like last year, I thought I would mention several albums that were good, but didn&#8217;t make the list [<sup>1</sup>](#note-6616-1 "All links are Amazon Affiliate links"){#return-note-6616-1.simple-footnote}.

This year&#8217;s most disappointing album was [Battle Born](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00973DDN2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00973DDN2) by The Killers. I was really looking forward to it, but goodness, what a mess. They seem miles away from the band that gave us [Hot Fuss](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1586S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000W1586S) & [Sam&#8217;s Town](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZYXPC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VZYXPC).

Sigur Ros** — [Valtari](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084P9202/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0084P9202)

This band is Icelandic. I have no idea what they&#8217;re singing, which is okay because some of their songs use a non-literal language&#8230;basically made up sounds. It&#8217;s called Vonlenska. Wikipedia calls them an ambient/post-rock band. It doesn&#8217;t matter their language, or what Wikipedia calls them&#8230;they&#8217;re good. The music is ethereal and mesmerizing.

Best song: Fjögur píanó

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6592" alt="grizzlybear" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/grizzlybear.jpeg" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/grizzlybear.jpeg 280w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/grizzlybear-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /> **4. Grizzly Bear** — [Shields](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098WWEH8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0098WWEH8)

I didn&#8217;t pick this album up until really late in the year&#8230;but I can&#8217;t stop listening to it. Initially it reminded me of My Morning Jacket. But Grizzly Bear is better, both musically and lyrically. This album features great harmonies between Edward Droste & Daniel Rossen.[

Best Song: Sun In Your Eyes

> Fallen once, you&#8217;ll fall again  
> And lean on  
> Your tired hands, the crawling grass  
> The soft ground

**<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6597" alt="lumineers" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lumineers.jpeg" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lumineers.jpeg 280w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lumineers-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" />3. The Lumineers** — [The Lumineers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007M45PMU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007M45PMU)

You know the Lumineers because you&#8217;ve likely heard _Ho Hey_ about a thousand times on the radio. Fortunately the album is more than that one song. And fortunately, most of the other songs are better than _Ho Hey_. Lyrically easy on the ears&#8230;and you can sing along with all the songs.

Best Song: Stubborn Love

> It&#8217;s better to feel pain, than nothing at all  
> The opposite of love&#8217;s indifference  
> Pay attention now, I&#8217;m standing on your porch screaming out  
> And I wont leave until you come downstairs

**<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6600" alt="monsters" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/monsters.jpeg" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/monsters.jpeg 280w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/monsters-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" />2. Of Monsters and Men** — [My Head Is An Animal](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007MU85D0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007MU85D0)

The guitar intro on the first song, _Dirty Paws_, instantly hooked me&#8230;and I didn&#8217;t stop listening. This is an  album that takes the listener from a story about bees, birds, and creatures with _Dirty Paws_ to a romantic discourse between lovers in _Little Talks_. Incidentally, this band is also from Iceland. What is it about good music coming from Iceland? I thought Björk was that country&#8217;s only export. The music is whimsical, wispy, a little folksy&#8230;and good.

Best Song: Little Talks

> You&#8217;re gone, gone, gone away  
> I watched you disappear  
> All that&#8217;s left is a ghost of you  
> Now we&#8217;re torn, torn, torn apart  
> There&#8217;s nothing we can do  
> Just let me go, we&#8217;ll meet again soon

Mumford & Sons** — [Babel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009A3NGF4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009A3NGF4)

In my past two years I&#8217;ve had albums that might have been _slightly_ controversial&#8230;nothing major, but enough for some to question. Maybe _Babel_ is this years controversy. Mumford, despite huge success and a brilliant first album, _Sigh No More_, have collected a group of haters along the way. Apparently Mumford is now formulaic&#8230;tired&#8230;not original. Apparently their second album was supposed to depart from who they are, and what made them successful. I don&#8217;t think U2 was asked to reinvent themselves on their second album. They didn&#8217;t try that almost disastrous experiment until their 8th & 9th albums. So let the haters hate. I love this album. It was easily my favorite album of the year. While _My Head Is An Animal_ was good, it really was a distant second.

This album is filled with arena worthy anthems. _Babel _ is more polished than it&#8217;s predecessor, but still fills familiar. It is pregnant with spiritual undertones and hard love. It slows down, speeds up, stops, and then does it all over again.

It&#8217;s hard to pick a favorite song on this album. In fact, it&#8217;s easier to pick the few songs I didn&#8217;t like as much. One song that really grew on me was _Lover of the Light_. A first listen caused me to pause and say, &#8220;wait a second, when did they become the Dave Matthews Band?&#8221; Listen to the beginning of the song&#8230;you&#8217;ll see what I mean. But once I saw the video it completely changed things for me. We lived in Wales (UK) for five years&#8230;and the video for this song was shot in Wales. We became fans of [Idris Elba](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252961/) while living there as well. Idris directed and starred in the video. It&#8217;s an excellent story. Watch for yourself.

Having said that, _Love of the Light_ isn&#8217;t my favorite song on the album. _Hopeless Wanderer_ gets that title. It reminds me of U2&#8217;s _I Still Haven&#8217;t Found What I&#8217;m Looking For_ (which happens to be my favorite song of all time). It&#8217;s a story of searching for truth&#8230;of knowing it, and then not.

> You heard my voice I came out of the woods by choice  
> Shelter also gave their shade  
> But in the dark I have no name
> 
> So leave that click in my head  
> And I will remember the words that you said  
> Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart  
> But I was sure we could see a new start
> 
> So when your hope&#8217;s on fire  
> But you know your desire  
> Don&#8217;t hold a glass over the flame  
> Don&#8217;t let your heart grow cold  
> I will call you by name  
> I will share your road
> 
> But hold me fast, Hold me fast  
> &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m a hopeless wanderer  
> And hold me fast, Hold me fast  
> &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m a hopeless wanderer

> I wrestled long with my youth  
> We tried so hard to live in the truth  
> But do not tell me all is fine  
> When I lose my head, I lose my spine
> 
> So leave that click in my head  
> And I won&#8217;t remember the words that you said  
> You brought me out from the cold  
> Now, how I long, how I long to grow old
> 
> So when your hope&#8217;s on fire  
> But you know your desire  
> Don&#8217;t hold a glass over the flame  
> Don&#8217;t let your heart grow cold

> I will share your road
> 
> But hold me fast, Hold me fast  
> &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m a hopeless wanderer  
> And hold me fast, Hold me fast  
> &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m a hopeless wanderer  
> I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I&#8217;m under  
> I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I&#8217;m under  
> The skies I&#8217;m under
