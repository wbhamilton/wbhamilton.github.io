Black Friday has become a ridiculous excuse to partake in the accumulation of junk&#8230;but that&#8217;s a rant for another day. Music, however, does not fall into the category of _junk_. And Black Friday brings about great deals on great music. Here are a few albums[1] you should go buy now:

  * [My Head Is An Animal &#8211; Of Monsters and Men](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007MU85D0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007MU85D0&linkCode=as2&tag=1twentyeight-20)<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=1twentyeight-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B007MU85D0" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />
  * [Born To Die &#8211; Lana Del Rey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZDS7CE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006ZDS7CE&linkCode=as2&tag=1twentyeight-20)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=1twentyeight-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B006ZDS7CE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
