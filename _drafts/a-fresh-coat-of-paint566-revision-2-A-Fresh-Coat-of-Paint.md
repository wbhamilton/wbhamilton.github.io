I&#8217;ve spent the last several weeks agonizing over the redesign of my [CommunityOne](http://www.communityone.org.uk) site. CommunityOne is a charity I established here in Cardiff in 2006. It was time for a fresh coat of paint. I also felt I needed to work on the branding a bit. I wanted something simple and clean, with fresh colors. I also wanted to experiment with new fonts, and using the new(ish) @font-face rule.

I decided to use the [Inspire](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=389&i=l76) theme from Woothemes as a base. I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be using the theme&#8217;s slider, but I liked the overall look of the theme. I was able to get permission from an artist named Kol on [deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com/) to use his wallpaper &#8220;[Grass Blades](http://-kol.deviantart.com/art/Grass-Blades-73597063)&#8221; as my background.

For the fonts I went with [League Gothic](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/7-league-gothic) in the logo and a few of the headings. I decided to use [Museo Slab](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-slab/) as the main body font and smaller headings. And there&#8217;s a little [Bello](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/bello/) that&#8217;s letterpressed into the header background. To use League Gothic and Museo Slab I decided to try out [Typekit](http://typekit.com). It was really simple. I created a free account, added the two fonts to my kit, and was given the CSS and javascript to use.

I also decided to individualize the four services CommunityOne offers. These are now color based. This will help in distinguishing what we offer and with promotional efforts.

The CommunityOne Twitter feed is now tied to the site. And it now has an official RSS feed&#8230;both were lacking in the last design.
