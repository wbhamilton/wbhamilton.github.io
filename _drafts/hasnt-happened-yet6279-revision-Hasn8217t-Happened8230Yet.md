As you know, I&#8217;m looking for a job here in Portland. It&#8217;s a pretty discouraging process, yet there a times when you realize it could be worse. Let me introduce you to Joshua Longbrake. He&#8217;s funny. Even better, he&#8217;s real. Here&#8217;s the money quote from his recent post, but go read the whole thing. How could you not want to know what the rest of the story is about&#8230;

> Matt and I were talking and I was putting money in the parking meter. Very suddenly, without any forewarning, I pooped my pants. That is the truth.

> “Hey Matt, I gotta go. I just pooped my pants.”

> I think I remember Matt saying OK.
