I recently attended the [Catalyst Conference](http://www.catalystconference.com/) in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the highlights was the meeting that took place between an African, Jimmy, and his Compassion International sponsor of 19 years. I&#8217;ve included the video below. If you&#8217;ve never considered sponsoring a child through Compassion International, or World Vision, I&#8217;d like to ask you to think about it.

Several years ago my family began sponsoring a little girl through World Vision that is the same age as our daughter. This year we&#8217;ve started sponsoring a little boy the same age as our son. For us, it&#8217;s a great way to be involved in the life of a child in need, for our children to get a sense that the world is a very small place, and to live out our call to be Jesus in all spheres and domains of life.
