Ignite Cardiff is happening again. This time it&#8217;s being held at the Wales Millennium Centre on Thursday, October 15th. I think Ignite is a really cool idea. Presenters get 5 minutes, 15 slides, 15 seconds per slide to talk about anything they want&#8230;although there is a &#8220;no self promotion&#8221; rule.

Unfortunately I&#8217;m unable to attend this year since I&#8217;m in the States. If you&#8217;re in or around Cardiff you should make plans to attend. Here are two links for you. The first is to the official Ignite Cardiff info page, through Cardiff Web Scene, and the second is my short review of Ignite Cardiff #2.

Enjoy.
