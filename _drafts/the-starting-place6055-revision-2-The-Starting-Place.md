The new Death Cab for Cutie album, [Codes and Keys](http://d.pr/KrWv), came out today. I like the album overall, but one song caught my attention in particular. The song is called &#8220;[St Peter&#8217;s Cathedral](http://d.pr/NZA8)&#8220;. Here are the lyrics:

> St. Peter’s Cathedral built of granite but ever fearful of the answer When the candle in the tunnel is flickering in sputters and fading faster  
> It’s only then that you will know what lies above or down below  
> Or if these fictions only prove how much you’ve really got to lose At St. Peter’s Cathedral there is stained glass, there’s a steeple that is reaching Up towards the heavens such ambition never failing to amaze me It’s either quite a master plan or just chemicals that help us understand That when our hearts stop ticking this is the end There’s nothing past this
