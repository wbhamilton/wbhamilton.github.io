I&#8217;ve spent the last several weeks agonizing over the redesign of my [CommunityOne](http://www.communityone.org.uk) site. CommunityOne is a charity I established here in Cardiff in 2006. It was time for a fresh coat of paint. I also felt I needed to work on the branding a bit. I wanted something simple and clean, with fresh colors. I also wanted to experiment with new fonts, and using the new(ish) @font-face rule.

I decided to use the [Inspire](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=389&i=l76) theme from Woothemes as a base. I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be using the theme&#8217;s slider, but I liked the overall look of the theme. I was able to get permission from an artist named Kol on [deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com/) to use his wallpaper &#8220;[Grass Blades](http://-kol.deviantart.com/art/Grass-Blades-73597063)&#8221; as my background.

For the fonts I went with [League Gothic](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/7-league-gothic) in the logo and a few of the headings. I decided to use [Museo Slab](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-slab/) as the main body font and smaller headings. And there&#8217;s a little [Bello](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/bello/) that&#8217;s letterpressed into the header background. To use League Gothic and Museo Slab I decided to try out [Typekit](http://typekit.com). It was really simple. I created a free account, added the two fonts to my kit, and was given the CSS and javascript to use.

I also decided to individualize the four services CommunityOne offers. These are now color based. This will help in distinguishing what we offer and with promotional efforts.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-568" title="services" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/services.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="258" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/services.jpg 610w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/services-300x126.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /> 

The CommunityOne Twitter feed is now tied to the site. And it now has an official RSS feed&#8230;both were lacking in the last design.
