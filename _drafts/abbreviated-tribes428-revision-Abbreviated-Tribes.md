Most of you have heard of [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/). Rich, marketing guru, who&#8217;s written several books. His latest is called [Tribes](http://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1591842336/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1244579582&sr=8-1). I liked the book. I didn&#8217;t particularly care for how it was written, no chapters, just sections. But overall I would recommend it to anyone really. You don&#8217;t have to be in the business world to appreciate it.

For those of you that don&#8217;t like to read, I thought I would just give you Seth&#8217;s TED talk. It&#8217;s an abbreviated Tribes.

Enjoy.
