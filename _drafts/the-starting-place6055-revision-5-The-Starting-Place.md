The new Death Cab for Cutie album, [Codes and Keys](http://d.pr/KrWv), came out today. I like the album overall, but one song caught my attention in particular. The song is called &#8220;[St Peter&#8217;s Cathedral](http://d.pr/NZA8)&#8220;. Here are the lyrics:

> St. Peter’s Cathedral built of granite but ever fearful of the answer  
> When the candle in the tunnel is flickering in sputters and fading faster  
> It’s only then that you will know what lies above or down below  
> Or if these fictions only prove how much you’ve really got to lose
> 
> At St. Peter’s Cathedral there is stained glass, there’s a steeple that is reaching  
> Up towards the heavens such ambition never failing to amaze me  
> It’s either quite a master plan or just chemicals that help us understand  
> That when our hearts stop ticking this is the end  
> There’s nothing past this

For those that would consider themselves to be Christians, believers, followers of Jesus – you need to recognize that these lyrics represent the starting place for many, especially across Europe and increasingly in the United States. This is what they believe.

After you&#8217;ve recognized this you need to understand why. Listen to them, ask them questions. Why do they believe what they believe? Don&#8217;t preach. Just listen. And please, do it in the context of relationship. Don&#8217;t grab a stranger and expect them have any vested interest in engaging with you in a spiritual conversation.

And go buy the album. It&#8217;s good.
