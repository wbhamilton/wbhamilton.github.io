My friend Jason Dietz, over at [NonModern](http://www.nonmodernblog.com/ "NonModern"), recently [posted](http://d.pr/KFl1) a list of his top ten cities to visit. I loved the list. Jason is much more traveled than I am, I&#8217;ve only been to two of his top ten cities, but I thought I would &#8220;comment&#8221; on his post by posting my own list of the top ten cities I&#8217;ve visited. Like Jason, I won&#8217;t include any city that I have lived in, currently or previously. Unlike Jason though, I don&#8217;t stop at the &#8220;city&#8221; designation, and will include a couple of &#8220;metropolis'&#8221; — I couldn&#8217;t resist.

10. Paris, France

9. San Francisco, CA

8. London, England  
I&#8217;ve been to London too many times to count, but central London never gets old. From the shopping (Regent St. & Covent Garden), to the sites (Westminster, Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park), to the museums (National Portrait Gallery), it doesn&#8217;t get much more touristy than central London.

7. Turin, Italy

6. Boston, MA

5. Bath, England  
Roman. Marble. Granite. Quaint. Shopping. Eating. It&#8217;s small size means you can walk central Bath in a day (easy). Almost every visitor we had while living in Wales we took to Bath for a day. When I&#8217;m asked about places to visit if taking a trip to the UK Bath is at the top of my list.

4. Budapest, Hungary  
I spent 4 days in Budapest in April, 2011. To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I&#8217;ve been told that Budapest carries the nickname &#8220;Paris of the East&#8221;. I wouldn&#8217;t doubt that. To walk along the Danube in the evening in central Budapest is simply breathtaking.

3. Florence, Italy

2. Barcelona, Spain

1. New York, NY
