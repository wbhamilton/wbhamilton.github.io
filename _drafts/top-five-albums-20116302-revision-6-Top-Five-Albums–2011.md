Despite what a friend said [last year](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums—2010/) about 2010 being a bad year for music, I thought it was a good year. Maybe that&#8217;s because Mumford & Sons _Sigh No More_ and Arcade Fire&#8217;s _Suburbs_ are 2 of my favorite albums. In fact, I would argue that 2011 was no better than 2010, and in some respects, a little worse. I don&#8217;t think there was a stand out album this year. There were definitely some good ones, but nothing grabbed me quite like last years albums did.  There were several good albums that didn&#8217;t make my top five&#8230;my Honorable Mentions if you will. They include in no particular order: The Black Keys – _El Camino_, Sigur Rós – _Inní_, The Decemberists – _The King is Dead_, Radiohead – _The King of Limbs_, and The Poison Tree – _The Poison Tree_. One album, in particular, was good, but didn&#8217;t quite live up to expectations, Coldplay&#8217;s _Mylo Xyloto_. And there was one album, that for the life of me I can&#8217;t quite figure out why it&#8217;s included in most everyone&#8217;s top 10 list – PJ Harvey&#8217;s _Let England Shake_. I thought it was a contrived, over sold, preachy, screeching mess. My top five this year leans toward the somber and sad, with one exception. My list is varied and very different from last years list. But like last year, I&#8217;m including an album that might incite a little ridicule by my friends. Oh well, I liked it.

#5 Adelle &#8211; [21](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4S4NM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004P4S4NM)  
<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6308" title="21" src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/21.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/21.jpg 280w, http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/21-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /> Like Brandon Flowers last year, this choice might catch a little ridicule. But let&#8217;s be honest, Adelle&#8217;s voice is second to none. The vocals on this album are simply amazing. I thought I would tire of this album after a few listens, but I keep coming back to it. Sad at times, empowering at others, well rounded, solid. Best song –

#4 Death Cab for Cutie &#8211; [Codes and Keys](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052YOXN4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0052YOXN4)  
Probably the most upbeat of my five albums (_Stay Young, Go Dancing_), and Death Cab for Cutie&#8217;s best album to date. Driving bass, a saloon piano, and maybe a little bit too much hi-hat. But you&#8217;ll be tapping your foot, and singing along. Best Song – _Portable Television_

#3 Fleet Foxes &#8211; [Helplessness Blues](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X0XA82/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004X0XA82)  
Wispy, airy, singing out in a wheat field kind of sound, but with amplification. The first three songs warm you up, almost like inside pitches in baseball, they get you ready – then Battery Kinzie is like a fastball right over the middle of the plate&#8230;a strong, sit up straight kind of song. Crisp guitars, tight vocals, a really nice album. Best song – _Helplessness Blues_

#2 Bon Iver &#8211; [Bon Iver](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054JURZA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0054JURZA)  
Listen to the first song, _Perth_, and wait for the swell at the 2:35 mark – you&#8217;ll be hooked. The lead singer, Justin Vernon, sings a lot in falsetto and it works. The song titles are mainly geographical (Perth, Minnesota, Hinnom, Calgary, Lisbon), and the lyrics may not make the most sense. But the album works, and you&#8217;ll want to continue to listen. Best Song – _Calgary_

#1 Elbow &#8211; [Build A Rocket Boys!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PVF95Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004PVF95Q)  
I am amazed at how this album has been left off list after list for top albums of the year. Maybe it&#8217;s because Elbow doesn&#8217;t get much play here in the States. I found Elbow, or maybe they found me, while living in the UK. Their previous album, _The Seldom Seen Kid_, was really good and was met with critical acclaim  – in the UK at least – but _Build A Rocket Boys!_ is exponentially better in my opinion. It is melancholy and somber, yet inspiring and uplifting. With songs like _Neat Little Rows_ it is anthemic, and it is reflective with _The Night Will Always Win_. The lyrics are tight, with each song telling a story. The music doesn&#8217;t get in the way, but is good enough to stand on it&#8217;s own. I simply love this album.

And let me say a few things about the album&#8217;s best song – _Open Arms_. There are very few songs that extend beyond themselves&#8230;that move you at your core&#8230;that touch your soul&#8230;that become part of the story of your life. Until _Open Arms_ the only song that I would put in that special category was U2&#8217;s _I Still Haven&#8217;t Found What I&#8217;m Looking For._ This song, this year, was for me. It **is** me. It is both the man I am, and the man I hope to be. In a year that was undeniably difficult for me this song brought me to tears, and face to face with God. Lyrically it captures the story of the prodigal son, found in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 15:11-32. It tells the story of a community that welcomes back with open arms the man that once left them. This community, in celebration, reminds the man of the boy he used to be, and says &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, you&#8217;re home, and you&#8217;re accepted.&#8221; I&#8217;m posting the lyrics below for you to read through, but if you have $5.00 go buy the album on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PVF95Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004PVF95Q), or just spend 99¢ on the song.

> You&#8217;re a law unto yourself  
> And we don&#8217;t suffer dreamers  
> But neither should you walk the earth alone
> 
> So with finger rolls and folding chairs  
> And a volley of streamers  
> We can be there for tweaks and repairs  
> Should you come back home
> 
> We got open arms for broken hearts  
> Like yours my boy, come home again
> 
> Tables are for pounding here  
> And when we&#8217;ve got you surrounded  
> The man you are will know the boy you were
> 
> And you&#8217;re not the man who fell to earth  
> You&#8217;re the man of La Mancha  
> And we&#8217;ve love enough to light the street

> Everyone&#8217;s here  
> The moon is out looking for trouble  
> And everyone&#8217;s here

> Everyone&#8217;s here  
> Everyone&#8217;s here  
> The moon wants a scrap or a cuddle

As always, I&#8217;d love to hear your opinion, and your favorites this year.
