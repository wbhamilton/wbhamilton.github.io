It&#8217;s time again for my top five albums of the year. As I was preparing for this post, and I&#8217;ve probably always known this, I realized that I&#8217;m while I love music, I&#8217;m not going to spend time searching for the unheard-of bands, or the albums that no one knows of. I&#8217;m not a true audiophile in that sense. But I do love good music. I could never compile a [list](http://www.stevekmccoy.com/reformissionary/2012/12/best-albums-of-2012.html) like Steve McCoy&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t have the time or the budget. And to be fair, I&#8217;m certain that there are several albums on Steve&#8217;s list that would be included in mine. No, my tastes are slightly more mainstream. And while you&#8217;ll never see the likes of today&#8217;s Pop Stars on this list you will most likely know the bands that are mentioned here.

Just like last year, I thought I would mention several albums that were good, but didn&#8217;t make the list [<sup>1</sup>](#note-6596-1 "All links are Amazon Affiliate links"){#return-note-6596-1.simple-footnote}.

This year&#8217;s most disappointing album was [Battle Born](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00973DDN2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00973DDN2) by The Killers. I was really looking forward to it, but goodness, what a mess. They seem miles away from the band that gave us [Hot Fuss](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1586S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000W1586S) & [Sam&#8217;s Town](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZYXPC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VZYXPC).

Sigur Ros** — [Valtari](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084P9202/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0084P9202)

This band is Icelandic. I have no idea what they&#8217;re singing, which is okay because some of their songs use a non-literal language&#8230;basically made up sounds. It&#8217;s called Vonlenska. Wikipedia calls them an ambient/post-rock band. It doesn&#8217;t matter their language, or what Wikipedia calls them&#8230;they&#8217;re good. The music is ethereal and mesmerizing.

Best song: Fjögur píanó

Grizzly Bear** — [Shields](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098WWEH8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0098WWEH8)

I didn&#8217;t pick this album up until really late in the year&#8230;but I can&#8217;t stop listening to it. Initially it reminded me of My Morning Jacket. But Grizzly Bear is better, both musically and lyrically. This album features great harmonies between Edward Droste & Daniel Rossen.[

Best Song: Sun In Your Eyes

**3. The Lumineers** — [The Lumineers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007M45PMU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007M45PMU)
