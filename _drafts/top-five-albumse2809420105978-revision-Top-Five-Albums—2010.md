Everyone has their lists this time of year, from top grossing movies to the top searches on Google. It only makes sense that I add my own list for 2010&#8230;albeit a short one. My top five albums for 2010 are not based on anything other than what I liked the most. Of course, I listened, and purchased more than five albums this year, but these are my favourite. Enjoy.

1. Mumford & Sons &#8211; Sigh No More.

In these body&#8217;s we will live, in these body&#8217;s we will die. Where you invest your love, you invest your life.
