## ME

Hello. My name is Brad, and this is 1twentyeight.com. Spouse = Julie. Offspring = 2 highschoolers. Originally from Texas. From 2006 to 2011 we lived in the United Kingdom (Cardiff, Wales) where I was the Director of a charity (non-profit), CommunityOne. This site was birthed during my time there. In August 2011 we moved to Portland, Oregon. After a brief stint at OCHIN, five years at [Puppet](http://puppet.com), and one and a half years as Director of Customer Success at [BlueVolt](http://bluevolt.com), I am now the Director of Customer Journey Solutions at [New Relic](https://newrelic.com)<sup>1</sup>.

I use 1twentyeight as a place to write about things that strike my fancy.
