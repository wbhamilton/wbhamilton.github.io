My apologies for the last two test posts. In redesigning and re-imagining my site I wanted to be more deliberate about posting links to things I find interesting. Sometimes I&#8217;ll comment in detail, but more often I&#8217;ll simply link to the site and tell you in one sentence why you should visit. This new format (my linked list) makes the title of my post the link to the website you should visit.

There are two ways you&#8217;ll be able to recognize this type of post. One, look over at the date. If there&#8217;s a little chain-link icon then you&#8217;ll know the title of my post is the link to the website I&#8217;m talking about. The other visual indicator is the star (â˜…) at the end of my post. By clicking the star you&#8217;ll be taken to the permalink for my post. This is helpful is you&#8217;re trying to reblog, or post a link yourself to my post.

And lastly, the RSS feed has been updated to mimic what I&#8217;ve just described. If I post a linked list article, the title in your RSS feed should take you directly to the other website, while the star will bring you to my original post.

Hope that makes sense. If not, shoot me question. And if you find that it&#8217;s not working for you let me know.

My inspiration for this type of linked list comes from sites like <a title="Shawn Blanc" href="http://shawnblanc.net/" target="">Shawn Blanc</a> and <a title="Daring Fireball" href="http://daringfireball.net/" target="">John Gruber</a>.
