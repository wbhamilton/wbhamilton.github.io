I've been asked by friends and family what I do, and maybe more confusingly, what is [Puppet Labs](http://puppetlabs.com)?Â I thought I would answer both with a very short video.

My job is actually quite simple. I am an Instructional Designer. That means that I create curriculum and training materials for the products that Puppet Labs provides. Puppet Labs provides IT automation software. Confused? You shouldn't be. It's not that complicated.

Watch this short video I created to explain what Puppet (the product) is that Puppet Labs (the company) provides.
