There are certain things that I have a thing for. Me having a thing for these things is what makes me me. Hope you followed that. I wouldn&#8217;t say that these things are things that I&#8217;m passionate about. I&#8217;ve written about the things that I&#8217;m passionate about [elsewhere](http://1twentyeight.com/2008/12/31/the-obligatory-new-years-post/). But these are things, some simple, some unfortunately expensive, that bring a smile to my face. They give me that nice little feeling in the place that you get nice little feelings. So, I give you&#8230;the things that I have a thing for:

  * [Moleskine Journals](http://www.moleskine.com/) &#8211; I currently have 7 Moleskines, each serving it&#8217;s own purpose. Here are the first 5 (from left to right):

2009 Pocket Weekly Notbook (soft cover)  
Address Book  
Large Plain Notebook (my primary journal)  
City Guide Journal (Barcelona)  
Small Plain Notebook (for taking notes in meetings or when I&#8217;m out in the city)

The next 2 Moleskines are my favorites. These were given to me by Julie this past Valentines Day. They are small lined pocket journals. They are from a limited edition made to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of the font Helvetica. They were made available at a museum exhibition in Japan, and had to be purchased from the Asia Moleskine website. They are still wrapped, and I haven&#8217;t decided when, or if, I&#8217;m going to open them. They&#8217;re just too cool to write in. And I figure if I do decide to write in them it better be something special I write about.

  * Pens &#8211; For some reason, ever since university, I&#8217;ve been on the hunt for the best pen that doesn&#8217;t require me to sell my organs on the black market. After all these years I still haven&#8217;t decided what the best is, or if I prefer rollerballs to ballpoints. I do know that fountain pens are at the top of the list, but not for everyday writing. A [Mont Blanc](http://www.montblanc.com/products/26.php) is on the wishlist, but it will have to be a Christmas present. Here&#8217;s what I use currently (from left to right): </ul> 
    Staples Optiflow Rollerball &#8211; not great, but can be used in a pinch.  
    Uniball Rollerball &#8211; my most used pen  
    Waterman Fountain Pen &#8211; the special occasion pen  
    Sensa ballpoint &#8211; first &#8220;real&#8221; pen I owned. Valentines gift from Julie years and years ago.  
    Parker Profile XL ballpoint &#8211; my current favorite

      * Watches &#8211; For some reason I just like watches. I like big watches, but if they get too big they look funny on my arm. I&#8217;ve owned Fossil, Guess, and until recently a Timex Helix, which I loved. I currently have a [Tissot](http://www.tissot.ch/products/) T-Touch (stainless steel), pictured below. The glass is tactile sapphire crystal which means that it is touch sensitive. I love the Tissot. By touching certain parts of the glass I can tell the temperature, altitude, barometric pressure, direction (compass), set an alarm, or use the chronograph.

      * Type &#8211; I&#8217;ve got a thing for type&#8230;or fonts&#8230;or more specifically, the use of fonts to convey a message. I&#8217;ve got favorites, but honestly, if you&#8217;re still reading at this point you don&#8217;t want to be reading about the names of fonts. So instead, I&#8217;ll show you a picture of a special find from a few weeks ago. Julie and I (and the kids) went about an hour northeast of Cardiff to a store called Bailey&#8217;s (I think). And I found this old type set. It has the complete alphabet, plus numbers and punctuation marks. I think the font is Helvetica Bold Condensed. I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;ll use it for, but I couldn&#8217;t pass it up.

    [<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-382" title="type set 2" src="http://www.thelifeandtimesof.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/dscn1025-300x225.jpg" alt="type set 2" width="300" height="225" />](http://www.thelifeandtimesof.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/dscn1025.jpg)
    
    So, that&#8217;s part of me. The things that I have a thing for.
