It's clear that this blog has become nothing more than a place to list my annual top five albums; but here's to consistency. A couple of notes before we get into the list. One, Coldplay — you should be ashamed of yourselves. Rumor has it that this album (_A Head Full of Dreams_), your 7th studio album, is your last. I'm not saddened. You've not produced anything worth listening to since _Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends_ (2008). Two, while I enjoyed _Wilder Mind_, and truly admire Mumford & Sons for departing from the norm (banjos, acoustic guitars, and a standing bass), this album was lyrically weak. Does every song on a 12 song album have to be about the complexity of love & relationship? Aren't there other topics you could write and sing about? Father John Misty makes me smile, and Adele has a voice like no other human on the planet.

### Honorable Mentions

  * Mumford & Sons - Wilder Mind
  * Of Monsters and Men - Beneath the Skin
  * Wilco - Star Wars
  * CHVRCHES - Every Open Eye
  * Father John Misty - I Love You, Honeybear
  * Car Seat Headrest - Teens of Style
  * Adele - 25

## The Top Five

### 5. Jamie xx - [In Colour](https://open.spotify.com/album/01uabHpYa9AA55wc6AwRQL)

This is like a subdued dance club album - as in, you can listen to it and not want to stick hot pokers in your ears. Think airy & effervescent, with a touch of cool.

### 4. Vance Joy - [Dream Your Life Away](https://open.spotify.com/album/5S9b8euumqMhQbMk0zzQdH)

This is probably the album that will catch some pushback. Outside the overplayed _Riptide_ this is a really good album. Musically clean and lyrically simple. Favorite track - _Georgia_

### 3. Death Cab for Cutie - [Kintsugi](https://open.spotify.com/album/6BK3muExDOuk0VnyMn9NVw)

I have a soft spot for Death Cab. I love them. I would put Benjamin Gibbard's lyrics up against any other singer/songwriter in the world. The writing is smart. Each song tells a story. A good story. The music won't blow you away&#8230;but I get lost in the lyrics every time I listen to this album. Favorite track - _Ingenue_

### 2. Alabama Shakes - [Sound & Color](https://open.spotify.com/album/2IVZPDXb7LFbyukqaoWpYR)

This is the album that I envision [Mike Milligan](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm29417472/nm0940158?ref_=nm_phs_md_1) (Fargo - Season 2) popping into the 8 track as he drives through the frozen north looking for Dodd Gerhardt. The beginning of the album — the start of the song _Sound & Color_ — is beautiful. Strong. Soulful. Get up and dance good. I can't stop listening to this album. Favorite track - _This Feeling_

### 1. Sufjan Stevens - [Carrie & Lowell](https://open.spotify.com/album/0U8DeqqKDgIhIiWOdqiQXE)

<img src="http://1twentyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-31-at-10.56.39-AM-150x150.png" /> It's hard to put into words how I feel about this album. It's move-you-to-tears good. It's named after Sufjan's mother, Carrie, who died in 2012, and step-father Lowell. It sounds different than his earlier albums. This album is hard. Beautiful. Entrancing. Emotional. Real. Raw. Hopeful. I like what [Steve McCoy](http://www.stevekmccoy.com/blog/2015/12/best-albums-of-2015) said about this album: &#8220;A warm hug and consoling whisper through the reverberating ache&#8221;. Don't play this at a party. While everyone will know they listened to an incredible record, they may go home depressed. It's hard to pick just a single favorite track on this album. All of it is so good. But if I'm forced it's _All of Me Wants All of You_.
