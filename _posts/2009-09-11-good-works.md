One of the things I&#8217;m passionate about is what I would call a Good Works Initiative. Simply, it&#8217;s about doing good works for others. Giving back. Assisting. Offering help. Creating something for the betterment of a person, group, or community. Some, like me, are motivated to do good works because of my faith. Not in some under-handed scheme to get the recipient to convert, but because I believe my faith requires nothing less than doing good for others. Others may not be motivated to do good works because of faith in a higher being, but it does not diminish their ability to have an impact on another&#8217;s life.

I&#8217;m seeing a lot of this good works initiative as I meet and talk with others and as I crawl the interwebs. Here are a few places I see the good works initiative being lived out: (disclaimer: some will be faith based while others will not)

Help-portrait.com is a group of photographers that will be providing free portraits to those that are less fortunate this holiday season.

I-HEART is a movement of people helping people &#8211; showing the love of God in practical ways, wherever need exists. Right here, real soon, you&#8217;ll find an online community with the sole purpose of offline action &#8211; sharing ideas, being inspired, shoulder to shoulder, part of the solution &#8211; transforming local initiatives into a collaborative global impact. But in the meantime, let&#8217;s take time to look beyond ourselves and truly see others&#8230;Their worth, their needs, their future. Because it&#8217;s together that we love&#8230; and think&#8230; and act. As one, I-HEART. (from the i-heart website)

TheCommon allows individuals to sign up for things they need help with, and then the community matches their respective abilities to help meet the need.

Kiva is a micro-finance organization that allows individuals to supply loans to entrepreneurs in many third world countries.

These are just a very small sample of organizations that are providing the opportunity for you and me to do good, to give back, to better the communities we&#8217;re a part of. I would like to encourage you to take part in the good works initiative.
