I apologize to my lone reader for my tardiness as I was traveling during the holiday season and did not plan appropriately for getting this post published. Also, subconsciously I’ve put this off for some time because this year, more than any I can think of since beginning my top five lists, was the most difficult. There were plenty of _good_ albums, but there were hardly any _great_ albums. Picking a tops list out of a plethora of good albums is exceptionally hard to do.

Previous years for context:

## Top Five

### 5. Janelle Monáe &#8211; Dirty Computer

This is the album of the year if inclusivity were the theme. And that may be the reason it struck a chord with so many. For me, I couldn’t help but think of Prince as I listened to the album. This is especially true for _Make Me Feel_. Apparently Prince wrote the synth piece for the song. It shows.

### 4. Lucius &#8211; NUDES

Lucius made the Honorable Mentions list in 2016 with _Good Grief_. This album is acoustic with covers, a couple of new songs, and stripped back versions from their back catalog. I love, love, love _Goodnight, Irene_ with Roger Waters from Pink Floyd.

### 3. Mumford & Sons &#8211; Delta

With _Wilder Mind_ finally, and thankfully, fading from the rearview mirror, _Delta_ gets us back to the Mumford we used to know, almost. Love, or love lost, continues to permeate Mumford’s songs. But this album seems to kiss spirituality on the mouth, as opposed to only flirting with it in past albums. I’d love to hear _The Wild_ live.

### 2. Death Cab for Cutie &#8211; Thank You for Today

This band can do no wrong by me. I’m an unashamed fanboy. This album offers nothing new, no experimentation. It’s just Death Cab being Death Cab and that’s why I love it.

### 1. Lucy Dacus &#8211; Historian

The first lyric on the first song just might throw you off, but keep listening; you’ll be rewarded with a sharp and sad story throughout the album. From a friend moving on to find themself, to a grandmother dying, you get the sense that you’re listening to real stories, not just some songs. And Lucy’s voice…goodness…it’s quite something.

Favorite song: _Nonbeliever_

> You deal in unspoken debt  
> No kindness without wanting something back  
> What do I owe you? What did I forget?  
> Are we even after all of that?
