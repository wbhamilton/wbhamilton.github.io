Yesterday I took part in my second [Photomarathon](http://www.photomarathon.co.uk/). I naively thought that [last years effort](http://1twentyeight.com/2010/06/13/twelve-in-twelve/) would provide invaluable experience for this year. But nothing can prepare you for the exhaustion that comes with trying to take 12 photographs over 12 hours on 12 different topics. And while I felt better prepared in terms of taking pictures that the judges would appreciate, and interpreting the topics in a _different_ way, I was still thrilled when the day was over and I could turn off my brain.

This year Julie and the kids played a big part in helping me. We had a great time as a family thinking through the shots and then executing them.

With a project like this self embarrassment (and the embarrassment of family members) is inevitable. I didn't start the day thinking I would photograph myself in the bath tub, or photograph my wife in a bikini walking down a path, or ask my 6 year old to take off his shirt in city centre, but these things happen when one is working under the strain of coming up with 12 ideas in 12 hours. If you can't allow yourself to be embarrassed it would make this project nearly impossible.

I also wanted to say that the team behind Photomarathon, Betina Skovbro, Mathew Talfan & the rest, did an absolutely fabulous job. To coordinate a one day event with over 400 participants in no small task. This year, and last, went as smoothly as possible â€” from a participants perspective.

This years topics were:
1. Entry Number + Work of Art
2. Inside Out
3. Community
4. Superpowers
5. Drama
6. The Great Outdoors
7. Double
8. My Secret
9. Element
10. Movement
11. Obstacle
12. I Have a Dream

Here are my first and last photos & a link to the entire set in Flickr.
