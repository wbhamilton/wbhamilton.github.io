My one and only post related to 2014 is this one. I took a new position last April at Puppet Labs; and haven&#8217;t slowed down since.

Like two years ago, this was not a strong year for albums &#8211; songs, yes &#8211; but not complete albums. And specifically, I was really disappointed with U2 and Coldplay. U2&#8217;s _Songs of Innocence_ was not great, which pains me to say. Coldplay had a couple of nice songs on _Ghost Stories_, but it was no where near a complete, solid album.

## The Top Five

### 5. Beck &ndash; [Morning Phase](spotify:album:2Qx7dgA5VjX8JDQaXVxzHu)

I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of Beck. His early stuff is almost repulsive. But this is a good album.

### 4. The Black Keys &ndash; [Turn Blue](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Blue-Black-Keys/dp/B00J7UL6V6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420343318&sr=8-1&keywords=the+black+keys)

There&#8217;s nothing overly special about this album. It&#8217;s the Black Keys, and they&#8217;ve been doing this for years. But they continue to deliver and this album is no exception. Turn this one up loud.

### 3. Delta Spirit &ndash; [Into the Wide](spotify:album:4hWx4cKcQKjq6uNGRJAnfL)

Apparently Delta Spirit has been around for a while. Who knew? I certainly didn&#8217;t. But in 2015 I&#8217;ll be returning to their back catalog. This is a really nice album. _Take Shelter_, _Into the Wide_, and _Push It_ are all excellent songs.

### 2. Vancouver Sleep Clinic &ndash; [Winter](spotify:album:71K84GjeSWMtFT3sKv3Poz)

If you like Bon Iver, you&#8217;ll like Vancouver Sleep Clinic. It&#8217;s the same Justin Vernon, just a new project. There&#8217;s only 6 songs on the album, but I just repeat the whole thing&#8230;over, and over, and over.

### 1. The War on Drugs &ndash; [Lost in the Dream](spotify:album:14xxjLlbGy8ACm4MorBjD5)

This was my wife&#8217;s find of the year, and her favorite album. She got it on vinyl for Christmas. Maybe these guys get their own genre &#8211; because they&#8217;re hard to describe. Honestly, at one point I thought John Cougar Mellencamp, then Bon Jovi, then the Boss, then Tom Petty&#8230;it&#8217;s odd. I don&#8217;t particularly care for those guys, and would hate to put The War on Drugs in the same genre&#8230;so I won&#8217;t. _Under the Pressure_, _Red Eyes_, _Eyes to the Wind_, and _Burning_ are excellent.
