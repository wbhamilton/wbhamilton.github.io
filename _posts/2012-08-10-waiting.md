Sometimes you only need a glimpse of something to know it's going to be good.

> Now I'll be bold  
> As well as strong  
> And use my head alongside my heart  
> So tame my flesh  
> And fix my eyes  
> A tethered mind freed from the lies  
> And I'll kneel down  
> Wait for now  
> And I'll kneel down  
> Know my ground  
> Raise my hands  
> Paint my spirit gold  
> Bow my head  
> Keep my heart slow  
> 'cus I will wait,  
> I will wait for you
