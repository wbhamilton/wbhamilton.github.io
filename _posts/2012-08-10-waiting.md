Sometimes you only need a glimpse of something to know it&#8217;s going to be good.

> Now I&#8217;ll be bold  
> As well as strong  
> And use my head alongside my heart  
> So tame my flesh  
> And fix my eyes  
> A tethered mind freed from the lies  
> And I&#8217;ll kneel down  
> Wait for now  
> And I&#8217;ll kneel down  
> Know my ground  
> Raise my hands  
> Paint my spirit gold  
> Bow my head  
> Keep my heart slow  
> &#8216;cus I will wait,  
> I will wait for you
