I&#8217;m not much of a sweets eater. If given the choice, I&#8217;d rather have a nice slice of pumpkin pie over a piece of chocolate anything. But, when you&#8217;re given chocolate as a gift you naturally accept it, eat it, and enjoy it. One of my Father&#8217;s Day gifts was a box of [Gu Cocoa Chocolate Truffles](http://www.gupuds.com/our-puds/chocs/cocoa-chocolate-truffles). The truffles are great, but the packaging the truffles came in were better.

I love clean design. Our first experience with Gu was with their [Gu-ey Chocolate Fondant Torte](http://www.gupuds.com/our-puds/decadent-tortes/gu-ey-chocolate-fondant-torte). I was immediately taken by the smooth black box the torte came in. Simple, clean, nice typography.

The packaging for the chocolate truffles was no different. Clean, simple, same great typography, a splash of pink on the lid, and a cool design on the inside. Here are a few snaps of my Gu chocolate truffles.
