I&#8217;m growing increasingly tired — and maybe a little frustrated — with bad rhetoric that&#8217;s being used in relation to Christian missions. You&#8217;ll read it as _Finish the Task_, _Finishing the Task_, the _Unfinished Task_, or _Finish the Mission_.

Depending on who you ask there are between 6,600-6,800 unreached people groups in the world today. An unreached people group is a grouping of people with a common language and culture that have less than 2% professing Christians. Recently, missions organizations have decided to further break down the world&#8217;s population by tracking UUPG&#8217;s (Unengaged Unreached People Groups). UUPG&#8217;s are those groups that have no present Christian witness. Again, depending on who you ask there are between 1,000 and 3,600 UUPG&#8217;s.

Setting aside the argument that this is a terrible way of tracking &#8220;lostness&#8221;, it tends to give the impression that something can be done about it. Somewhere along the way we thought that God&#8217;s reconciliation with His creation was about us, and that if we try hard enough, and travel to the unreached places, we can usher in His return. What silly thinking.

I&#8217;d love to live long enough to see each UUPG &#8220;reached&#8221;. I wonder, the day that happens will the sky split open to see God&#8217;s Kingdom return?
