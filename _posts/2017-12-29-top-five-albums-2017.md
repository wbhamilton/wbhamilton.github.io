It seems bonkers that this is my 8th annual Top Five Albums post. What's not bonkers is that it's the only post on this site all year. I'm nothing if not consistent.

First, here are the previous years for comparison:  
[2016](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums-2016) | [2015](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums-2015) | [2014](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums-2014) | [2013](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums-2013) | [2012](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums-2012) | [2011](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums-2011) | [2010](http://1twentyeight.com/top-five-albums%e2%80%942010)

Second, this was the year of the concert for me. Early in the year Julie and I went to Radiohead. That was followed by a trip to Seattle with my son to see U2's _Joshua Tree_ tour. I killed two birds at that concert as Mumford & Sons opened. Later in the year we saw The National at "The Schnitz" (Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall). This concert was simply amazing. The Schnitz is a perfect venue for music and The National did not disappoint. To date it is my second favorite concert of all time, only being surpassed by the U2 Elevation concert in February of 2002. I attended that show in Kansas City and it included U2's tribute to 9/11. While nothing can compete with that emotionalism, The National came pretty close. Julie and my daughter saw The Killers just a few weeks ago (I was happy to skip that one). But, I was super bummed that I missed out on a chance to see Elbow here in Portland. All in all it was a great year of live music.

Like 2014 & 2015 I need to file a couple of complaints. U2, you're killing me. _Songs of Experience_ is dreadful. Arcade Fire, be careful. If I'm not mistaken _Everything Now_ is your 5th studio album. I'll give you a pass on releasing something this bad...but you've been warned.

Most, if not all of these albums, plus a few more from 2017 can be found on this Spotify Playlist: [URL](https://open.spotify.com/user/wbhamilton/playlist/09xk95IiUu44aK1L3f7mOb)

Now to the things I did like:

### Honorable Mentions

  * Fleet Foxes - _Crack-Up_
  * Kendrick Lamar - _DAMN_
  * Father John Misty - _Pure Comedy_
  * The Shins - _Heartworms_
  * Vagabon - _Infinite Worlds_

## Top Five

### 5. Big Thief - [Capacity](https://open.spotify.com/album/2hOYLjoRQFXcdviMiwtgxe)

Big Thief is new to me, but I'm glad I found them. Maybe they're new to a lot of people as this is only their second album. This is an excellent album. I like it not necessarily for the music, but for the lyrics. Each song tells a story, some of them not easy, but all of them good. _Mythological Beauty_ is one of my favorites.

### 4. LCD Soundsystem - [american dream](https://open.spotify.com/album/0hdimlCTCms7otJCX9OvqM)

You might be fooled into thinking this is a feel good album based on the music, but like _Capacity_ it's emotional, and sorrowful, and sad. But man is it a good listen. It's tough to combine techno and somber, but you just have to love an album with a song entitled _Emotional Haircut_.

### 3. The War on Drugs - [A Deeper Understanding](https://open.spotify.com/album/4TkmrrpjlPoCPpGyDN3rkF)

If you read the 2014 Top Five you'll remember The War on Drugs holding the top spot. This album is just as good. Yeah, they still remind me of Springsteen. Did you know that The War on Drugs is made up of a 38 year old one man band? Yeah, me neither. This is another album filled with sadness. Maybe that's the theme for this year.

### 2. Elbow - [Little Fictions](https://open.spotify.com/album/1WDcOG8RXdNbPdFFuN1mec)

I've said this before, I'll say it again. I have no clue how this band is not more popular; especially within my demographic. I love love love this album. Musically, lyrically, all of it. It's a slow grey day with a whiskey and a cigar kind of album. And yeah, more sadness. Go listen to the song with the album's name, _Little Fictions_. It's my favorite song of the year.

> We protect our little fictions  
> Like it’s all we are  
> Little wilderness mementos  
> But there’s only you and me here  
> Fire breathing  
> Hold tight  
> Waiting for the original miracle

### 1. The National - [Sleep Well Beast](https://open.spotify.com/album/6zG9PHw8dlMLIyRE9TEGGk)

The previous high mark for The National was number three in 2010 with _High Violet_, but they get the top spot this year. Indie rock? American rock? I'm not sure what genre they live in, and ultimately it doesn't matter; the songs on this album aren't easy. _Turtleneck_, the end of _I'll Still Destroy You_, _The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness_, are all musically manic and lyrically morose. If you're going through the five stages of grief this should be the soundtrack for your life. And seeing them perform these songs live adds a whole different dimension. Pitchfork says of this album that Tom Berninger isn't singing about how to enjoy life, but how to endure it. Agreed.

Favorite song: _Guilty Party_

> You're sleeping night and day  
> How d'you do it?  
> Me I am wide awake  
> Feeling defeated
>
> I say your name  
> I say I'm sorry  
> I know it's not working  
> I'm no holiday  
> It's nobody's fault  
> No guilty party  
> We just got nothing  
> Nothing left to say
>
> Another year gets away  
> Another summer of love  
> I don't know why I care  
> We miss it every summer
>
> I say your name  
> I say I'm sorry  
> I'm the one doing this  
> There's no other way  
> It's nobody's fault  
> No guilty party  
> I just got nothing, nothing left to say
>
> It all, all catches up to me  
> It all, all catches up to me all the time
>
> I say your name  
> I say I'm sorry  
> I know it's not working, I'm no holiday  
> It's nobody's fault  
> No guilty party
