In the past few months I've tried to increase the amount (number of books) I read. One, it helps with [this problem](http://1twentyeight.com/2010/10/22/the-buggles-were-right/). Two, it increases knowledge - both specific and general. And three, it gives me something to talk about with others.

I thought I would share with you the books I've read. I recommend all of them, otherwise I probably wouldn't share them with you. But obviously I recommend some more than others, so I'm including the official 128 Star (★) Rating. One ★ means you might not want to read it unless you're just really bored. Five ★'s means &#8220;Don't miss this. Go buy it right now.

In no particular order:

  * A Million Miles in a Thousand Years — Donald Miller. ★★★★
  * Outliers: The Story of Success — Malcolm Gladwell. ★★★★★
  * The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference — Malcolm Gladwell. ★★★
  * Forgotten God: Reversing Our Tragic Neglect of the Holy Spirit — Francis Chan. ★★★
  * Counterfeit Gods — Tim Keller. ★★★★
  * The Prodigal God — Tim Keller. ★★★
  * Seeing God in the Ordinary — Michael Frost. ★★★
  * [HTML5 for Web Designers](http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers) — Jeremy Keith. ★★★

Outliers is a game changer. It will cause you to look at the world around you very differently. The HTML5 book has a limited audience, but the others are suitable to anyone really and can be found on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fbooks-used-books-textbooks%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D283155%26ref_%3Dsa_menu_bo0&tag=1twentyeight-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957).
