I recently completed a course offered through [ffotogallery](http://www.ffotogallery.org/courses.php) called &#8216;Photographing People&#8217;, which was taught by [Toril Brancher](http://torilbrancher.wordpress.com/). I really enjoyed the course. It was much more than f-stops, shutter speeds, and flash guns. It was a walk through photographic history, paying special attention to those that have specialized in taking photographs of people. We talked about [David Hurn](http://www.google.co.uk/images?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&biw=1084&bih=1231&tbs=isch%3A1&sa=1&q=david+hurn&aq=f&aqi=g2&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=), [Henri Cartier-Bresson](http://www.google.co.uk/images?client=safari&rls=en&q=henri+cartier-bresson&oe=UTF-8&redir_esc=&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=yV8TTdqFMdS0hAen7KG3Dg&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CDIQsAQwAA&biw=1084&bih=1231), [Sally Mann](http://www.google.co.uk/images?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&biw=1084&bih=1231&tbs=isch%3A1&sa=1&q=sally+mann&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=), and [Elinor Carucci](http://www.google.co.uk/images?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&biw=1084&bih=1231&tbs=isch%3A1&sa=1&q=elinor+carucci&aq=0&aqi=g2&aql=&oq=elinor+caru&gs_rfai=), among others. We talked about the qualities in images that we&#8217;re drawn to, and how we mere amateurs might have taken a shot differently. I can highly recommend ffotogallery, their instructors, and their courses. This was my second course through ffotogallery, and I plan to take more.

Throughout the 10 week course we were working towards a final project of 10 images based on a theme of our own choosing. My theme was entitled **Nuclear**. The following images are the 10 I submitted for my project. (* linked to image in Flickr)
