Today on my Twitter [stream](http://twitter.com/wbhamilton) I've been posting my all time top 5 songs from U2. I'm headed to the concert in Dallas tonight and am a little pumped about it. U2 is my favorite band, with Joshua Tree as my favorite album. I've seen U2 four times dating back to their 1997 Pop Mart tour. That show was held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. The next three shows went indoors...once in Reunion Arena, once in the new(er) American Airlines Center, and once in some arena in Kansas City. Tonight's is back to the outdoors (kind of) in the new Cowboys Stadium. I've read good reviews of the opening band, Muse, and am excited to hear them live for the first time.

## Here's my top 5 (and a couple of honorable mentions):

  1. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For
  2. One
  3. Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses
  4. Walk On
  5. Yahweh

## Honorable Mentions:

  1. 40
  2. Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own
  3. Magnificent
  4. Gloria

I'll have a review of the concert tomorrow.
