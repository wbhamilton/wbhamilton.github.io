I&#8217;m not much for New Year&#8217;s Resolutions. To me, they are thinly veiled goals, which the average person isn&#8217;t good at setting and keeping anyway. I&#8217;m not a big goal setter, so it only makes sense that I wouldn&#8217;t be a resolution setter.

I [read](http://www.sbcimpact.net/2008/12/31/new-years-resolutions/) yesterday where John Stickley, in writing about the same topic, quoted the Apostle Paul who said,

> For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.

That&#8217;s quite a resolution. But for the not-yet follower of Christ this type of resolution probably carries little weight. Even for the follower of Christ it needs to be unpacked a little.

I thought I would take a shot at unpacking it by talking about affection. Typically, our affections are stirred toward someone or something. It&#8217;s a general fondness or liking of someone (something). And when we have an affection towards someone (something) we are usually influenced by that person (thing). I&#8217;ve started thinking about what stirs my affections for Christ. This is not new, others have [written about it before](http://dwelldeep.net/?p=31), but it&#8217;s a new way of thinking for me. So, what are those things in my life that stir my affections for Christ&#8230;those things that put my focus where it should be and result in a natural worship of God and an increased involvement in His mission. Here&#8217;s a short list of things that stir my affection for Christ. It&#8217;s not exhaustive, will probably change, and is no particular order:

  * spending time with Julie
  * the laughter of my children
  * the book of Romans (the Apostle Paul&#8217;s letter to the church in Rome)
  * anything by [John Piper](http://www.desiringgod.org) (sermons, books, podcasts)
  * a good conversation with close friends
  * most songs by [U2](http://www.u2.com/)

My encouragement to you in this new year&#8230;find those things that stir your affections for Christ and focus on them. Don&#8217;t resolve to be a &#8220;good&#8221; person or a &#8220;better&#8221; person. One, what is a &#8220;good&#8221; person anyway, and two, you won&#8217;t succeed. Instead, allow your affections for Christ to be stirred and you will be better for it.

Cheers.
